extends BaseCharacter

## The talking mushroom of the village: rests, then walks to a random spot near home along the
## stage's A* grid (GridPathfinder, through its PathAgent); when the fox presses F next to it, it
## stops and talks. Not an enemy: no hit or hurt area, and no Carried / Thrown states — the fox
## can't pick it up.

## How far from where it was placed the mushroom wanders, in meters.
